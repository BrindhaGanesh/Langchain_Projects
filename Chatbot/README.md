# ðŸ“š Simple chatbot app 
This is a small project I made using **LangChain** and **OpenAI**.

It is a simple chatbot application.
User can ask questions to the chatbot until the user types exit.
This application is not useful for real problems. It does not remember the previous questions, so there is no context.

Solution : we need to maintain the chat history and send the whole history to the LLM model. check: Chatbot_with_context_app.py
